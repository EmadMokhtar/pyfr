# 🔥 PyFr - The Python Microservice Framework

PyFr is the **game-changing Python microservice framework** that eliminates weeks of boilerplate setup and delivers **production-ready services in under 10 minutes**. Inspired by GoFr's revolutionary architecture and powered by cutting-edge tools like UV, Ruff, and OpenTelemetry, it's the framework that transforms microservice development from painful to **absolutely delightful**. Perfect for teams who demand excellence without complexity!

> PyFr is influenced by [GoFr](https://gofr.dev), the Go microservice framework that has redefined how teams build and deploy services. With PyFr, you get the same **context-driven architecture** and **developer experience excellence**, but tailored for Python's rich ecosystem.

## **🔥 The Painful Reality We're Solving**
Building Python microservices is **unnecessarily brutal**. Developers waste **2-4 weeks** configuring observability, database adapters, testing frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment infrastructure. Every team reinvents the same wheel, leading to:
- 💸 **Massive time waste** on repetitive boilerplate
- 🐛 **Inconsistent practices** across teams  
- 😩 **Developer frustration** with complex tooling
- 🚨 **Production incidents** due to poor observability
- 📉 **Slow time-to-market** for new features

## **✨ Our Revolutionary Solution**
PyFr provides a **comprehensive, battle-tested framework** that eliminates microservice complexity while maintaining complete flexibility. Built on proven patterns from GoFr and the latest Python ecosystem innovations.

## **🚀 Why Teams Are Making the Switch**

### **⚡ 10x Faster Development Velocity**
- **Production-ready service in 10 minutes** vs 2-4 weeks of manual setup
- **Backstage integration** for one-click service creation
- **Pre-configured everything**: databases, observability, testing, deployment
- **Zero cognitive overhead** - focus on business logic, not infrastructure

### **🏎️ Performance That Dominates**
- **UV package management**: 10-100x faster builds and installs
- **Ruff linting**: 10-100x faster code quality checks
- **Async-first architecture** with optimal resource utilization
- **Production-optimized containers** with multi-stage builds

### **🔍 Observability That Actually Helps**
- **OpenTelemetry distributed tracing** - follow requests across your entire system
- **Prometheus metrics** with pre-built Grafana dashboards
- **Structured logging** with correlation IDs and request context
- **Kubernetes-ready health checks** that prevent outages

### **🎯 Developer Experience Excellence**
- **Context-driven architecture** inspired by GoFr's innovative patterns
- **Comprehensive testing** with pytest, testcontainers, and property-based testing
- **Modern tooling integration** (UV, Ruff, pre-commit) that just works
- **Extensive documentation** and real-world examples

### **🐳 Production-Ready From Day Zero**
- **Security-scanned Docker images** with minimal attack surface
- **Kubernetes manifests** with auto-scaling and resource management
- **CI/CD templates** for GitHub Actions, GitLab, and Jenkins
- **Multi-database support** without vendor lock-in

## **🌟 Join the PyFr Revolution**
If you're tired of the **painful reality** of Python microservices, it's time to embrace the **PyFr revolution**. Our framework is designed for teams who demand **excellence without complexity**.
